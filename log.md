# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday, 21/01/25

<h1 align="center">Day 0: Tuesday, January 21th 2025</h1>

**Today's Progress**: Started planning two dnd related projects to finally get out of tutorial hell and to actually have something to show in future job/apprenticeship interviews.. One is a simple dice simulator website that I want to have finished by the 4th of January (my first apprenticeship interview this year) and the other one is a visual spellbook website that I'm giving myself no time limit for as it's gonna be a bigger project that I'll be updating every time I learn something new or get a new idea. I then started mapping out all the functions and the layout of the dice website using mostly comments.

**Thoughts:** Forced myself to get through the first part of The Odin Project which was pretty boring since it was mainly just revision for me, but I wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing any of my basics. I'm excited to get back into the intermediate lessons.
